==========

Downstream processing of Illumina 450k Methylation data generated as part of the TCGA Project

This package is mainly aimed towards analysing a set of data which contains 2 groups that are being compared to each other eg: Tumor vs Normal. 

The package aims to provide tools to automate tasks such as filtering and dichotomizing data, analysing purity content, automated cluster assignments of samples, identifying epigenetically silenced genes and various visualization strategies

Will update this file with more details as more functionality is added
